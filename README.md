## Readme.txt - ToDoList Project in C#

### Introduction

This C# project, `ToDoList`, is a simple command-line application that allows users to manage their daily tasks and create a to-do list. The application provides features to add, view, edit, and mark tasks as completed.

### Features

The ToDoList project includes the following features:

1. **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list by providing a task description, due date, and priority level.

2. **View Tasks**: Users can view all the tasks in their to-do list. The tasks are displayed in a list format, showing the task description, due date, and priority.

3. **Edit Task**: Users can edit existing tasks to update their descriptions, due dates, or priority levels.



### Usage

To use the ToDoList application:

1. Run the `ToDoList.exe` executable file.

2. A menu will be displayed with various options, such as adding a task, viewing tasks, editing tasks, etc.

3. Choose the desired option by typing the corresponding number and pressing Enter.

4. Depending on the option selected, the program will prompt you for additional information, such as task descriptions, due dates, priorities, etc.

5. The program will perform the requested operation and display the updated task list or relevant information.

6. You can save your to-do list by selecting the appropriate option in the menu. The saved list will be loaded automatically the next time you run the program.

### Notes

- The application uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to manage tasks and their properties.
